# Project Express API

The project was to make an express api using a json file, in this case I chose Netflix titles.

## The problem

For this project I used the resources available from the Technigo bootcamp and followed the instructions, if you did it was more or less a codealong but with your own values. We worked only with the supplied API and in the localhost. The main problem at first was how to think about the respective endpoints and how to get the result you wanted from the .json file.
